User prompt:

now everything works fine just make sure when the user is approved the apply button in the 6th card in the @templates/dashboard.html changes to approved as after applying it shows pending ... and if the user is rejected make sure it shows rejected ... also design the @templates/premium_users.html in the same style as @templates/user_approval.html
